                <p>Nuts are sources of protein, fats, fibres, vitamins, and minerals.
                They also regulate body weight as their fats are not fully absorbed. 
                Nuts regulate food intake, and help burn energy.</p>

                        <p> The almond is often thought of as a nut, though it's technically a drupe fruit 
                        produced by the almond tree (Prunus dulcis; Prunus amygdalus). It's native to
                        North Africa, West Asia, and the Mediterranean, though most almonds today are 
                        grown in the United States, Spain, and Italy. Eat almonds where ever you found them!! </p>

                        <p> The peanut, also known as the groundnut, goober, pindar or monkey nut, and 
                            taxonomically classified as Arachis hypogaea, is a legume crop grown mainly for its
                            edible seeds. It is widely grown in the tropics and subtropics, being important to both 
                            small and large commercial producers.(Wikipedia) </p>

                        <p> The cashew tree (Anacardium occidentale) is a tropical evergreen tree that 
                            produces the cashew seed and the cashew apple accessory fruit. The tree 
                            can grow as high as 14 m (46 ft), but the dwarf cultivars, growing up to 6 m 
                            (20 ft), prove more profitable, with earlier maturity and greater yields. (Wikipedia) </p>

                        <p> The Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) is a South American tree in the family Lecythidaceae, 
                            and it is also the name of the tree's commercially harvested edible seeds. It is one of the 
                            largest and longest-lived trees in the Amazon rainforest. The fruit and its 
                            nutshell – containing the edible Brazil nut – are relatively large.
